# phase6-app

Apple Screentime cannot be opened for a website for all the time (at least it does not work).

This script bundles the web packge of the popular vocabulary trainer [Phase 6](http://phase-6.de/) as a native mac app using [Nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier). This app can then be enabled to get screen time all the day.
